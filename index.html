            <p class = "pText">I've been collection Trading Cards pretty much all my life, when I was able to afford stuff on my own, and have amassed a fair collection.
                I started off collection Pokemon Cards back in high school as it was popular at the time. I then got facinated by Yu-Gi-Oh! as I watched the anime
                and started a collection of that. Then as I got older i started to get into Magic the Gathering and just have cards dotted all over the place in my room.
                I also have a few random cards that I picked up from a convenction one time I remember going too.
                <br>
                <br>
                However since the pandemic I have lost the desire to play with my cards and some of them have just been sitting in my cupboards doing nothing.
                Therefore I have decided to sell my stuff and its a good idea to do so. It gets rid of clutter and gives me a few extra bucks.
                There's a few good stuff i've found in this collection which i'll be selling as singles but most of the stuff I'll sell as a bundle.
                Or if your looking through the collection and want to ask about something message me and I'll get in touch I can be pretty resonable.
                <br>
                <br>
                So thanks for looking through my collection it was fun setting this up and I hope you find something your looking for. Here's just a showcase of what I've got.
